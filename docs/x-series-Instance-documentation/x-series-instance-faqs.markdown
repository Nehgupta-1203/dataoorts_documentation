<summary>Is it necessary to secure my SSH access after launching the VM ?</summary>
Yes, it is highly recommended to secure your SSH access. You should either reset the SSH key or configure firewall rules to allow access only from authorized IPs. By default, a temporary.pem key is generated for instance access, but for enhanced security, you should replace it with your own SSH key. Detailed instructions on updating your SSH key can be found in our documentation [Here](https://dataoorts.document360.io/v1/docs/ssh-fortify).
