## GC2 Instance Restrictions
We have implemented these limitations on our instances to ensure you can work confidently while we also enjoy our coffee time peacefully. Our security validation and limitation protocols have been thoroughly researched and cover nearly all use cases, allowing you to work without hassle. These measures primarily come into play when detecting malicious or illegal activities, such as crypto mining or intentional attempts to compromise our systems. Rest assured, your normal work wonâ€™t be affected by these safeguards.

### GC2 Limitations:
1. Prohibition of Crypto Mining: Users are strictly prohibited from engaging in any form of cryptocurrency mining activities within our system.

2. Illicit Code and Interference: Users must refrain from running unsophisticated or illegal code or making intentional attempts to interfere with our host-node system.

3. Resource Allocation: While we cannot guarantee full GPU memory and threads availability at all times, users will receive their reserved quota.

4. AI Monitoring: All processes within the instance are subject to monitoring by our AI system.

5. Any Attempt to Security Breach/File System Modification: Any attempt to breach or bypass our system security measures or isolation protocols, or interfere with the host-node file system, is strictly prohibited.

6. Port Limitation: Opening more than five ports is not allowed.

7. Harmful Linux Commands: Users must refrain from running Linux commands that may cause hindrance or harm to the system, especially long bash scripts.

8. GPU Memory Utilization: Users are advised to use GPU memory judiciously, especially when running large models. Utilization of GPU memory should not exceed one-third of the total available memory of that particular GPU to ensure optimal performance and to avoid resource contention issues.

9. Process Limit: There is a limit on the number of processes users can start simultaneously. Instance

10. Start Failure Notification: In case an instance fails to start but remains visible in the dashboard, users are required to notify us and delete the instance to avoid incurring additional costs.

11. Beta Testing Conditions: As we are currently in the beta phase, instances may be automatically terminated for updates or other reasons, albeit in rare cases.

> Users are expected to comply with these terms to ensure the smooth operation and security of the platform. Failure to adhere to these terms may result in the suspension or termination of user accounts and services. We reserve the right to take appropriate actions to enforce compliance and maintain the integrity and security of our platform.


### Security and Isolation
Our modern security protocols are designed to safeguard instances against security breaches and malicious or illegal activities. However, we are flexible and can modify these protocols to better serve your specific requirements.
